## University Network System - Cisco Packet Tracer Project

# Overview
This project simulates a university network infrastructure using Cisco Packet Tracer, showcasing how a real-world network is built using multiple routing protocols and essential network services like DNS and DHCP.


## The project integrates

- EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
- RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
- OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
- Static Routing
- LAN Design with VLANs
- DNS (Domain Name System)
- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

--- 

## Tools & Technologies

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Routing Protocols: EIGRP, RIP, OSPF, Static
- Switching & VLANs
- LAN Design
- DHCP Server for Automatic IP Assignment
- DNS Server for Name Resolution
- Subnetting & IP Addressing

---

## Features

- Configured EIGRP, RIP, OSPF, and Static Routing
- Department-wise LAN design with VLANs
- DHCP server for automatic IP address allocation to end devices
- DNS server for resolving hostnames in the network
- Inter-VLAN Routing
- Realistic University layout: Admin, Faculty, Labs, and Library
- Connectivity tested using ping and nslookup
